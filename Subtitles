How to Customize Subtitles on 123movies

123movies has long been a go-to platform for streaming a vast library of movies and TV shows for free. However, one area where users often seek guidance is customizing subtitles to enhance their viewing experience. Subtitles are crucial for understanding foreign languages, enhancing comprehension, and aiding those with hearing impairments. In this article, we will explore how to customize subtitles on 123movies to make your streaming experience more enjoyable and accessible.
Understanding Subtitles on 123movies
123movies typically provides built-in subtitles for many of its movies and TV shows. These subtitles are automatically generated and can be enabled or disabled according to user preference. However, the options for customizing these subtitles directly on 123movies are somewhat limited. Despite these limitations, there are still ways to adjust and enhance your subtitle experience using external tools and settings.
Enabling Subtitles on 123movies

Enable Subtitles: Look for the subtitle icon on the video player (usually represented by a "CC" or similar symbol). Click on this icon to enable subtitles.
Customizing Subtitles Using External Tools
Since 123movies does not offer extensive subtitle customization options, using external tools can help you achieve the desired subtitle appearance and functionality.

Search for Subtitles: Go to Subscene or OpenSubtitles and search for the subtitle file corresponding to your movie or TV show.
Download the File: Download the appropriate subtitle file (usually in .srt format) to your computer.
2. Using a Media Player
To customize subtitles, consider using a media player that supports external subtitle files and offers robust customization options. VLC Media Player is a popular choice for this purpose.

Open the Video File in VLC: Download the video file from 123movies or use a screen recording tool to save the content. Open this file in VLC.
